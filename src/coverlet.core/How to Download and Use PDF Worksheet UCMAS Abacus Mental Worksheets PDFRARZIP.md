## What is UCMAS?
 
UCMAS stands for Universal Concept of Mental Arithmetic System. It is a program that teaches children and adults how to use the abacus, an ancient calculating tool, to perform mental math calculations. The abacus consists of beads that slide on rods in a frame. Each bead represents a different value depending on its position and rod. By manipulating the beads, one can perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and other operations mentally.
 
UCMAS aims to develop both the left and right hemispheres of the brain by stimulating the visual, auditory, and tactile senses. It also helps to improve concentration, memory, speed, accuracy, creativity, and logical thinking. UCMAS has been adopted by many schools and institutions around the world as a way to enhance the learning abilities of students.
